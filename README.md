Overview

Through meticulous data examination and visualization, this project explores various aspects of vehicle sales. Key findings include trends over time, popular car makes, 
manufacturing year, and other features. The analysis provides valuable insights into market dynamics and consumer preferences.

Project Workflow

1- Data Exploration and Preparation:
  *  Import crucial Python libraries and load the data.
  *  Explore dataset columns and values, checking for any duplicated or missing values and addressing them.
  *  Clean the data and handle missing values.
  *  Create additional columns to facilitate analysis.


2- Data Analysis:
  *  Analyze the dataset for correlations.
  *  Visualize correlations and trends.
  *  Display important data summaries, including mean, minimum, and maximum values for relevant columns.
  *  Generate plots to illustrate relationships between factors and their impact on selling price, as well as trends by color, make, and year.

3- Key Findings:
  *  Strong and moderate correlations observed, such as between odometer and year, and between MMR (Manheim Market Report) and selling price.
  *  Identification of the most sold car makes, years, and models.
  *  Clear visual representations of results through plots.

Summary

In summary, the analysis reveals valuable insights into vehicle sales dynamics. By leveraging data examination techniques and visualization tools, 
the project offers stakeholders actionable intelligence to navigate the competitive automotive marketplace with confidence and foresight.
